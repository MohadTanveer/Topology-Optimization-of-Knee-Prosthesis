# Topology-Optimization-of-Knee-Prosthesis
Topology Optimization for a Knee Prosthesis
This repository contains the Abaqus Input (.INP) file for a Topology Optimization model designed for knee prosthesis applications. The aim of this project is to optimize the structural design of a knee prosthesis to minimize material usage while maintaining structural integrity and performance.

Topology optimization is a computational design approach that seeks to distribute material within a defined design space in an optimal way, given specific load conditions and constraints. The model used in this project is tailored for knee prostheses to ensure the prosthetic part can bear appropriate loads and stresses during function while remaining lightweight and functional.

**knee_prosthesis_optimization.inp**: This is the main input file for Abaqus, which contains all the model definitions, boundary conditions, material properties, and optimization parameters used in this topology optimization study.

Download the knee_prosthesis_optimization.inp file from this repository.
